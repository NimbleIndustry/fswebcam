This is a Golang wrapping of the fswebcam application. Suitable for use in a go-based application that needs webcam functionality on *nix.

For an example use, see the unit test.

To include in a project:

```
$ export GOPATH=`pwd`
$ go get -d github.com/NimbleIndustry/fswebcam
$ cd src/github.com/NimbleIndustry/fswebcam
$ ./configure
```

Then in your application, simply import the fswebcam project. Again, see the unit test for an example usage.

Original README follows....

fswebcam - Small and simple webcam software for *nix.

Created by Philip Heron <phil@sanslogic.co.uk>

This is the program used to generate images for a webcam. It captures a number
of frames from any V4L or V4L2 compatible device, averages them to reduce noise
and draws the details on it using the GD Graphics Library which also handles
compressing the image to PNG or JPEG.

INSTALLING

Run the following commands in the source folder to build and install fswebcam:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

It's only requirements are that the GD library be installed with JPEG, PNG
and FreeType support.
